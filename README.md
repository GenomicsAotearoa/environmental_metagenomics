### Metagenomic binning

The workflow and software used in the [Environmental Metagenomics](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/environmental-metagenomics) project. This does not explain how to install or maintain the software in the project, but if you are working on the *New Zealand eScience Infrastructure* (NeSI) then all software will be already available.
