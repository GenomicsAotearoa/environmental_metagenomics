# Sequence processing and assembly

Hooray! You have just received sequencing data. Before embarking on reconstructing genomes or finding viruses, the immediate next steps are to:
1. Evaluate read quality
1. Trim adaptors and/or bad quality bases
1. Assemble contigs/scaffolds
1. Evaluate assembly

These steps are dependent on the nature of the data, such as: 
- Sequencing platform<br>
  *We primarily work with Illumina or Oxford Nanopore for short- and long-reads, respectively*
- Sample type<br>
  *DNA or RNA? Environmental communities or isolate populations?* 

This section is divided into four parts, each of which deals with specific type of sequence data.

1. [Short-read DNA sequencing of microbial communities](1.metagenomics_hiseq.md)
1. [Long-read DNA sequencing of microbial communities](2.metagenomics_longread.md)
1. [Short-read RNA sequencing of microbial communities](3.metatranscriptomics_hiseq.md)
1. [Long-read DNA sequencing of microbial isolates/population](4.isolates_longread.md)
