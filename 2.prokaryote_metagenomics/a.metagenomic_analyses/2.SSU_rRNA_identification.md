# Recover 16S rRNA from assembled reads
Perhaps one of the most intuitive thought after obtaining metagenomic reads is "What does the community/population look like?" Often, this is investigated using 16S rRNA amplicons. You may also have done some amplicon-based survey and want to see if your analyses results from metagenomic reads are congruent with them. Unfortunately, assemblers tend to produce misassembled and fragmented  16S rRNA sequences ([Miller *et al.* 2011](http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R44)). Thus, other tools are required to reconstruct and identify 16S rRNA sequences from the reads themselves. Here, we can use two tools: 
- **EMIRGE** ([GitHub page](https://github.com/csmiller/EMIRGE), [Miller *et al*. 2011](http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/5/R44), [Miller *et al*. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056018)) 
- **phyloFlash** ([GitHub page](http://hrgv.github.io/phyloFlash/), [Gruber-Vodicka *et al*. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00920-20)).
