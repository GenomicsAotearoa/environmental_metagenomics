# Prokaryote metagenomics

## Introduction

In this section, we focus on characterising the functional and taxonomic profile of prokaryotic sequences in the assembled contigs/scaffolds. This section is split into 2 parts:

- a. Metagenomic sequence analyses
- b. MAG construction

These 2 parts complements, but are also independent of, each other. Most of the work done in the Handley lab requires both parts, as we are interested in the overall microbial community and its function. However, this is entirely dependent on your research question(s) (and to a certain extent, data quality). For example, if you are only interested in the functional profile of your samples, you may not need to construct MAGs.

## Required data

- Quality trimmed reads
- Assembled contigs/scaffolds
